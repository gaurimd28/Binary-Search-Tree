# 🧠 Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation in Python

This project is a **menu-driven Binary Search Tree (BST)** implementation in Python.  
It includes essential operations such as **insertion, deletion, search, traversals**, and additional features like **copying, mirroring, depth calculation, and level-order traversal**.

---

## 📂 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how a Binary Search Tree works internally — including how nodes are inserted, deleted, and traversed using different algorithms.

The implementation uses **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python for modularity and clarity.

## ⚙️ Features

| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Insert** | Adds a new node to the BST. Duplicate keys are ignored. |
| **Delete** | Removes a node (handles all three deletion cases). |
| **Search** | Finds a specific value in the BST. |
| **Inorder Traversal** | Displays nodes in sorted order. |
| **Depth Calculation** | Computes the maximum depth (height) of the BST. |
| **Mirror Image** | Converts the tree into its mirror image. |
| **Copy Tree** | Creates a deep copy of the current BST. |
| **Display Parent Nodes** | Displays parent nodes along with their child nodes. |
| **Display Leaf Nodes** | Shows all the leaf (end) nodes of the tree. |
| **Level Order Traversal** | Breadth-First Traversal displaying nodes level-wise. |
